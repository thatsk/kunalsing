Social buttons (rendered above the footer) are great for having a small hub with all your social footprint.

You can edit them with the following variables:

<pre><code data-trim class="yaml">
social:
  - title: "facebook"
    url: "https://facebook.com/kunalsing452"
  - title: "twitter"
    url: "https://twitter.com/kunalsingthakur"
  - title: "github"
    url: "https://github.com/thatsk"
  - title: "bitcoin"
    url: "https://www.coinbase.com/join/57a16d2402373e0317982539"
  
</code></pre>

The title selects the desired [Font Awesome](https://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/icons/)
icon and it shouldn't include the "fa-" prefix.
